This project is about using Web APIs and asynchronous programming to build a web app
that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather based on the user's location and
dynamically refresh the user interface.

-- The most important step : Ensure that Node and the packages needed to build the server (express, cors, and body-parser) 
are installed .To establish a Project Environment
-- Making sure Node and packages installed, and included in (server.js) file.
-- To enable proper data extraction from the server, POST and GET routes were added.
-- The OpenWeatherMap website provided API credentials by Using GET route
